Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[226] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[226] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[227] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[228]', 2: 'In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks".[224] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[229] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41% thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding "not very important" and 8% responding "not at all important".[230][231]', 3: 'In November 2023, a global AI safety summit was held in Bletchley Park to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[232]', 4: 'History'}, 29: {0: 'Main article: History of artificial intelligence', 1: 'For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence. The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[233] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".[s][235] The first paper later recognized as "AI" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons" in 1943.[236]', 2: 'The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[t][2] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[u] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":[v] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[w][3]', 3: 'By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[240] and laboratories had been established around the world.[241] Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".[242] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating \'artificial intelligence\' will substantially be solved".[243]', 4: 'They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[x] Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[245] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\'s and Papert\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[246] The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[5]', 5: "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[247] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[4] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[6]", 6: 'Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.[248] A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.[249] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[y]. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[84][254] But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[255] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[256]', 7: 'AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[257] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence".[258]', 8: 'Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[8]', 9: "Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[7] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[z] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[260] graphics processing units, cloud computing[261]) and access to large amounts of data[262] (including curated datasets,[261] such as ImageNet).", 10: 'Deep learning\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[aa] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019,[226] and WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents[263] According to \'AI Impacts\', about $50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI";[264] about 800,000 "AI"-related US job openings existed in 2022.[265]', 11: 'In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues.

Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[ab] but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks"[268]', 2: 'Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of "acting" and not "thinking".[269] However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. "Aeronautical engineering texts," they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making \'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\'"[270] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".[271]', 3: 'McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world."[272] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as "the ability to solve hard problems".[273] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.', 4: 'Another definition has been adopted by Google,[274] a major practitioner in the field of AI.

Moravec\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.[278] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[279] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree.[ad][13]', 3: 'The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[281][282] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision.

Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain.
