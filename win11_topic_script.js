No problems in mixed networks (nas, samba shares..)\n\nCons: Windows animations and virtual desktop switching sometimes hangs. Backup features have been hidden in control panel as "windows 7 backup" and default options are not enterprise grade.\n\n'}, {4: 'date: October 18, 2023 | user: Xavier S. | \n\n"The newest king...or is it?"\n\nPros: The style and look of Windows 11 is cool. And it is always nice to have a new interface. You can also customize it to look like Windows 10 if you desire and that is amazing. I also enjoy that it is free to use, you can use it without a license and you will only get a watermark on your screen.\n\nCons: Microsoft is trying really hard for it not to run on older hardware and that is not right. It should be available to all who want it, especially since they are not going to support Windows 10 after 2024. There are ways around it but it is so complicated for the average user who does not need to upgrade their computer. I am still not sure if it is worth upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11. I think you should run Windows 10 until they stop supporting it.\n\n'}, {5: 'date: October 2, 2023 | user: Shawn O. | \n\n"Windows 11 - The best version of Windows since XP"\n\nPros: The new UI is much better and easier to use than the last few versions of Windows has been. It is sleek and smooth. Everything is easy to find in the settings and very easily customized to suit the needs of the teams or individuals using the OS.\n\nCons: At this point the only con I can think of is that the updates are very large and for some of our machines that has been an issue but we have been able to mitigate this.\n\n'}, {6: 'date: September 25, 2023 | user: Julius M. | \n\n"Windows 11 Review"\n\nOverall: my overall experience with Windows 11 has been technically great. it gives the power to create, manage- and complete tasks without worrying about functionality.\n\nPros: What I like the most about Windows 11 is that it has the ability to multi-task giving the advantage to complete my tasks on time. its features like creating multiple Desktops have been great.\n\nCons: There isn\'t much I don\'t like about Windows 11.\n\n'}, {7: 'date: September 24, 2023 | user: Bharathi M. | \n\n"Next Gen Update "\n\nOverall: It\'s very good but need some updates like windows defender issue.\n\nPros: We can work on multiple windows at the same time with our liking, its interface looks futuristic and best in class\n\nCons: Windows defender is slowing the computer by using most of the memory from the hardware and software.

The user interface is modern and stylish. You get mac inspired taskbar in the middle along with the latest news area on the bottom left. Most of the modern applications work flawlessly and there arenâ€™t any issues in regular use! Overall itâ€™s safe to say that Windows 11 is Microsoftâ€™s best OS yet and it only keeps getting better.\n\nCons: While there are no major cons Windows 11 can definitely get better with a few more theme customisation options and bringing back Windows Vista style widgets!

Me encanta que es una versiÃ³n mÃ¡s estÃ©tica, en palabras sencillas mÃ¡s bonita , amigable y ademÃ¡s segura.

I love that you can have multiple desktops to switch between depending on what you are doing. This is a feature that I didn\'t know that I needed but I use daily.\n\nCons: I would like the ability to switch between dual monitors with the click of a button rather than downloading third-party software that provides this capability.\n\n'}, {15: 'date: May 17, 2023 | user: meet M. | \n\n"no comparision"\n\nOverall: Nothing short of perfection. New features new interface, new layout.\n\nPros: It has a more beautiful and consistent design than previous windows, It has more video gaming features with high performance, and It allows more Android apps to run.\n\nCons: I don\'t think any short side about the software just that it has changed some interface that will take some time to get used to.\n\n'}, {16: 'date: May 2, 2023 | user: Turan A. | \n\n"Of course our choice is Windows 11"\n\nOverall:  All adaptation and transition processes were at a minimum level. We got a maximum conversion with minimum resources. You can understand a faster, more visual structure and performance difference. Simple but useful menus, easy filing and directory structure provided quick access and adaptation. Maybe it is the product that we provide the fastest adaptation among all MS Windows versions.\n\nPros:  Microsoft did not break tradition. We were thinking what can be put on more technology, it offered us more. After all the updates we made on our system on the day Windows 11 was released, we started to use all values such as performance, image, quality, functionality, speed, resource at the maximum level. It offered an integrated structure thanks to increased speed, performance, minimum resource consumption, more functional menus and components, as well as increased security levels. All upgrade processes were completed simply and easily. It provided ease of use by getting full marks for all of our users. Streamlined interface structure, fixes in drag-and-drop technology, file explorers, more accessible management structure, and using its technology as a GPU in cases where performance is required are great benefits.\n\nCons:  Actually this is not a problem. As MS users, we cannot abandon tradition. Problem with merging windows in taskbar requested by my users. It would be great to be able to show the windows as separate groups.\n\nReasons for Choosing Windows 11:  Thanks to the secure and integrated core operating system provided by MS, a lot of resources are not needed. In this way, all MS Windows provide you with them in one place. Security, performance, speed, a strong structure, less resources, much more efficiency, a simple and easy interface, a more manageable and adaptable structure.\n\n'}, {17: 'date: May 1, 2023 | user: sergio G. | \n\n"Like the system updates "\n\nPros: Windows keep growing and we grow with them.

I appreciated the new interface and features, which made using the operating system more enjoyable and efficient. While the initial setup process was a bit of a hassle, once I had the operating system up and running, I didn\'t encounter any significant issues or problems. Overall, I would recommend Windows 11 as a solid and modern operating system that offers many useful features and a great user experience.\n\nPros: I really liked the new interface of Windows 11. The Start menu and taskbar were redesigned, and the overall look and feel of the operating system felt modern and polished. Additionally, the new features such as the snap layouts and snap groups made multitasking much easier and more efficient.\n\nCons: One thing that I didn\'t like about Windows 11 was the initial setup process. The process was quite lengthy and required a lot of manual configuration, which was time-consuming and frustrating. Additionally, some users reported compatibility issues with certain hardware and software.\n\n'}, {19: 'date: April 13, 2023 | user: Jhordann C. | \n\n"Sistema Operativo"\n\nOverall: Agradable no he tenido mucho inconvenientes\n\nPros: La interfaz es muy amigable es de fÃ¡cil uso para el usuario y no consume mucha memoria\n\nCons: Las actualizaciones a veces traen muchos errores y malogran la operatividad fluida del sistema operativo\n\n'}, {20: 'date: April 1, 2023 | user: Pedro C. | \n\n"Uma janela sempre presente "\n\nPros: O software tem m interfeice perfeito com o utilizador tornando a utilizaÃ§Ã£o com o computador muito intuitiva.\n\nCons: Cada vez mais os recursos para que o software corra numa mÃ¡quina Ã© maior, o que obriga a alteraÃ§Ãµes no hardware.\n\n'}, {21: 'date: January 30, 2023 | user: Steve R. | \n\n"It\'s the worst windows ever.

I am missing Filemaker, which means I cannot do any database business. I am missing Wordpefect, which means I cannot do any word processing. I am missing the Block tax program. None of there are free programs. Even if I were to buy and install them, I would sti be missing my fonts. So I w il be basically off today until after the Geek tech comes over and takes a look. for $125/hour. I hope he can restore the damage. Otherwise we will have to spend a bundle to buy the missing programs and then configure them.\n\nPros: Nothing, See below. Right at the moment there is nothing to like.\n\nCons: Here is what has happened with my computer:Sometime Friday night or Saturday morning (January 27-28, 2023), my computer downloaded a Windows 11 update. When I started work Saturday morning it said I had to restart the computer, so I did. When it was finished updating I had Windows with an unfamiliar desktop wallpaper. My Chrome browser was missing, so I had to download it again, then I noticed other changes: All of my files were gone, all of my programs (like Filemaker, Wordperfect, H&R Block, Scribus) were gone. There was no memory before January 28, no restore dates. I troubleshot as best as I could. It took all morning. I had a conversation with a BestBuy tech who said he could not find my files and it looked like my hard drive was wiped and replaced.Later on Saturday I found some, maybe all, of my files in a directory that was created on January 27 on the E drive. My pictures were there and some of my documents. I found Wordperfect in the driver file, but it was a setup program. When I tried to install it, my license was rejected as already used. So I aborted the setup. I did download and setup Scribus (a free program). It could not find any \'recent\' scribus files to open, but I did on the E drive directory and moved one to the C drive. Scribus did open it, but it was a mess: myfonts are all gone so Arial was substituted for all of them missing fonts. None of the graphics were there--probably because they were moved by the update.

What is also nice, is that the software (at least the basic one) is free when upgrading from Windows 10. The continuous support and regular updates are also a great way to improve the product performance and remove the bugs.\n\nCons: There are couple of points I don\'t really like with this release. First, and the most annoying for me so far, is the need to click on show more option whenever I right click on an item. Also, the shutdown option doesn\'t really shut down the computer (at least with the default settings) like before.

The system runs fast, and it does keep an edge over Mac alternatives in managing apps, and most of the software existing out there.\n\nCons: There are several shortcuts working far from expected and represented a step backward in comparison with Windows 10. Things in the task bar need a right click instead of the traditional one. Looking for a network demands to open the network software instead of deploying the visible ones as it used to happen straightaway. It is not supported by many desktops, even more powerful than some newest alternatives. There is no Android apps support as suggested when first launched.\n\n'}, {39: 'date: June 30, 2022 | user: Ricardo M. | \n\n"Windows 11, Good Operational System "\n\nPros: It is an operating system with a very friendly graphical interface, it has security improvements and it is much more functional. This has also improved performance so it is much faster when executing programs, files and any other of its functions.\n\nCons: One of the things that I did not like is that it is more complex to use for the user, the mail application was not renewed. Although its view is friendly, you can see details in the windows and it resembles the view of Windows 8. The Cortana assistant does not appear through the installation or in the taskbar by default.\n\n'}, {40: 'date: June 29, 2022 | user: Ali L. | \n\n"Windows 11 is the next step for Microsoft to upgrade to a new modern responsive UI."\n\nOverall: Easy to use nice modern UI although it didn\'t fully complete the transition to the modern UI, still stock between the old UI and new modern responsive UI. Alot of privacy concerns specially the requirement to use an online account to be able to login, which makes me consider switching to Linux.\n\nPros: Windows 11 has made huge leaps in Microsoft path to build a modern Operating system with a responsive modern UI that supports all kinds of screens while still preserves the compatibility with the software and device drivers built for old versions of Windows. Windows 11 brings alot options to control privacy, although the app permissions i not yet fully integrated for old software, it only works for Windows Modern apps.\n\nCons: Unlike Linux or Android which are open source Operating Systems built by the community for the community, Microsoft Windows 11 is an operating system built by a large corporation as a product with alot of limitation for software developers or users to access the source code to audit how it works or what it does in the background. Windows can be packed by any kind of backdoors which no one can know about but the Microsoft employees who have access to the source code. Also the greatest thing about Linux kernel is that it comes packed with all drivers for most of the devices so there isn\'t a need to install any drivers, unlike Windows which requires you to always get more propriety pieces of software from the devices makers to be able to use those devices, which also comes with big security risks since most of the devices in the market today are from certain countries which are not very trust worthy when it comes to privacy. Microsoft requires drivers to be signed but there are so many loop holes in the signing process which makes it not as transparent as the open source drivers included with the Linux kernel. Microsoft also requires using a Microsoft online account to be able to login to Windows, which is a big security risk and has alot potential for breaching the users privacy and tracking their activity.\n\n'}, {41: 'date: June 23, 2022 | user: Verified Reviewer | \n\n"Windows 11 review"\n\nOverall: overall experiance is wonderful, new layout and some GUi changes, amazing experiance\n\nPros: enhanced and improved performance some GUI changes, Can run anroid apps without bluestack, enhanced gaming experience and task view.\n\nCons: i have not seen any issues or downside from the time I started using it.\n\n'}, {42: 'date: June 22, 2022 | user: Jonathan Alexander C. | \n\n" A modern, friendly and secure operating system"\n\nOverall: We have been migrating in recent months to this new operating system and it has been positive in the sense that we have more modern and secure equipment in terms of updates and threats.\n\nPros: What I like most about this new Microsoft operating system is its modern and friendly interface and that it keeps up to date with updates, which makes it safer when it comes to any threat, also that it is more oriented to the end user and does not both technicians, which makes the end user feel more comfortable.\n\nCons: What I like least is that some options were changed in location, which at times is difficult to find, but it is something that little by little the user gets used to and learns.\n\n'}, {43: 'date: June 10, 2022 | user: Victor G. | \n\n"excellent system"\n\nPros: It is extremely fast, it has new and better features that give a better use and a better environment when using the system.\n\nCons: I installed windows 11 since it came out, and the first week it gave me a black screen and it restarted, after it was updated, it has never happened again, this would be the only thing that has happened to me\n\n'}, {44: 'date: June 6, 2022 | user: Steve G. | \n\n"Windows 11 is a worthwhile upgrade, highly recommended"\n\nOverall: Overall windows 11 is a very great system.

Luckily they kept most of the details the same as windows 10 so its not too much of a learning curve to learn how to use/assist co-workers & staff. highly recommend upgrading from the dated windows 10 OS.\n\nPros: Windows 11 has very minimal changes, but overall feels much faster. Most of the bugs have been fixed since launch with their monthly updates. As far as for commercial use/work use I would believe its ready to be deployed and start testing your software with it. For end-users there isnt much of a difference other than the start menu & the taskbar aswell as the context menu. Its very quick, looks modern & has plenty of new features for IT Admin security.\n\nCons: The least favorite thing about windows 11 is the context menu. I dont understand why they got rid of all of the options and now I have to click "show more options" every single time i need to do something. There should be an easy setting to revert back to the regular context menu.
