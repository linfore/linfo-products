            <p>This is an AI/ML-powered data processing tool for transforming unstructured contents into a semi-structured format, for effective information presentation, faciliating content comprehension, and with actionable customer insights.</p>
            <p> In today's age, data or information overload is a common problem for both businesses and consumers. When the amount of data is huge, even a simple summary produced by the most advanced AI models like ChatGPT is often not enough. For example, on the Amazon.com site you may see a summary of user reviews as a new feature, but when there are thousands of reviews, a short summary is not enough to help you make a purchase decision, and reading through a long list of reviews takes a lot of time and makes the user experience stressful.</p>
            <p>Similary, a long article or content can often create the well-known "Too Long, Didn't Read" response, resulting in the intended information not being consumed.</p>
            <p>This application is based on a cognitive principle of how people process and consume information, which is further based on a new theory in information quantification for natural language contents. This application is implemented using advanced Al models and NLP algorithms to transform a large amount of raw data into a format that is easily consumed by users.</p>
